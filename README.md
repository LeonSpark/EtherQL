EthereumSQL
----

EthereumSQL is a query layer for Ethereum blockchain, written in Java and backed by MongoDB. 

It provides a RESTful API that is ideal for building scalable web applications or analyzing blockchain data.
EthereumSQL is designed to be fully compatible with [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum).

For much of the core protocol logic, EthereumSQL makes use of the [EthereumJ](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj)
library.

EthereumSQL was built at [Advanced Data Analytics Lab](http://ada.suda.edu.cn), with the goal of providing
a data query infrastructure on Ethereum. It is currently in very alpha beta,
and not recommended for production use until it has received sufficient testing.
